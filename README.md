# COVID19_Property_Pandemic

## Overview
We are attempting to create a machine learning model that can predict housing prices. Using [this dataset from Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) we are going to create a pricing model with data from 2018-2019 and a pricing model with data from 2020. Using our pricing model, we will atempt to see if Covid-19 has affected the housing market compared to the predicted values. We will be using a wide range of programming and data visualization tools including but not limited to Javascript, postgres SQL, Python, and Tableau.
